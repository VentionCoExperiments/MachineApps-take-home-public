## Completing an Exercise

1. **Read the requirements carefully** in the exercise README
2. **Set up the backend** following the backend README
3. **Set up the frontend** following the frontend README
4. **Implement the required features**
5. **Write tests** for your implementation
6. **Document your work** including any assumptions and design decisions

## Testing Your Work

## Tips

- **Start early** - give yourself enough time to complete the exercise
- **Ask questions** - if requirements are unclear, reach out for clarification
- **Focus on quality** - we value well-tested, clean code over feature quantity
- **Document your decisions** - explain your thought process
- **Keep it simple** - don't over-engineer the solution
